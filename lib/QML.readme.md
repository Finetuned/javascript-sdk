# Running in QML

You need to modify bundle.js (or bundle.min.js) :

As the first line, add :

```
var window = {
   Â XMLHttpRequest: XMLHttpRequest, 
};
var setTimeout = function (fn, ms) {};
var clearTimeout = function (timeout) {};
```

This will disable request timeouts, because QML doesn't support `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`.

And at the end of the file, add :

```
function GetClan() { return window.Clan; }
```

Now you can `import 'bundle.js' as Api;` and use `var Clan = Api.GetClan();` and use Clan normally.
